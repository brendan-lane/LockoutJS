Introduction
------
Hello! My name is Brendan, and I created a piece of software that allows you to stop all actions on a website until you enter a key.
This was used by me a couple times during 7th grade (which is when I made it) to stop people from messing with my projects while I was in the restroom.

FAQ
------
**All questions are in the format of _Question | Answer_.**
+ Is this project going to be updated in the future? | No, as I am working on other projects, and trying to balance time in school (make sure I have studied, done homework, etc.) this project will not be updated. Maybe if there is a crutial flaw, I will come an update it, but until then, no.
+ Can I contribute to the project? | Yes, that is why this project was filed as completed for me, but not archived. I will review all merge requests for this project. If it gets too complicated I might make a wiki for it. You will also be featured in the contributors section.
+ What happens if I forget my key? | There is a master key that can be used. It is `UcdDjbxUtgVk9mduLqVVAeXX4JLWVf`.
+ Is this secure? | No, this is not secure. It is very weak, as I designed it around the average JS knowlege of my school. It can be easily broken, so do not complain when someone breaks it. It is ment to be a wood fence, not an unbreakable box.
